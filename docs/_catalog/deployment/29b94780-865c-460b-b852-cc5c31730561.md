patternInfo: >
  The design represented by the nginx-deployment.yaml file sets up a basic web server infrastructure using Kubernetes resources.

  Key Components:
  - Namespace (nginx-namespace): A separate namespace to isolate and organize the Nginx application.
  - Deployment (nginx-deployment): Deploys a web server using the Nginx image with two replicas.
  - Service (nginx-service): Exposes the Nginx application to the external network via a LoadBalancer service type.

  Purpose of the Design:
  This design demonstrates how to deploy a simple, scalable web server using Kubernetes, helping users understand Kubernetes resource relationships and traffic flow.
patternCaveats: >
  1. LoadBalancer Requirement: Needs cloud provider support for external access.
  2. Namespace Conflicts: Careful management of nginx-namespace to avoid resource conflicts.
  3. Resource Availability: Cluster must have sufficient resources for two Nginx replicas.
  4. Default Nginx Config: Basic settings not suitable for production without customization.
